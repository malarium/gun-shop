# gun-shop
Project of in-game shop where player can buy weapon

***

All the content is generated dynamically in JavaScript.
At the beginning of the JS code there is an array of objects - just add another one with proper key-value pairs and it will be dynamically added to the shop.
It should be read from some database, but it's just a sample, hence items are hardcoded in JS.

Works so far on Chrome and Opera. Will add Fiorefox shortly.
